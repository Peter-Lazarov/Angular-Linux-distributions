# Angular-project-at-SoftUni
This project is a final examination for the Angular course and I made it to show my level of skills with this technology.

## The theme I choose is Linux operating systems:
From couple of months I plan to test and learn these operating systems. Now after five months of experience with Kubuntu and 2-3 days with Xubuntu I still learn and enjoy of these systems.

The Angular site implement many of the learned technologies.
- Routing mechanics - for navigate thru the site
- User mechanics - Register, Login and Logout
- User state management
- Route guards for logged in user and owner(publisher of content)
- CRUD - Create, Read, Update and Delete functionality.

The site is some kind of catalog for different Linux distributions.
- Adding - System from combine of Desktop environment and Distribution
- Read - Showing all systems, show details of the system
- Editing - System depending on is user is owner(publisher of current system)
- Deleting - Delete specific system
- Commentary - for the systems
